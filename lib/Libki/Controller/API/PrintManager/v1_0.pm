=head2 get_pending_job

Print server API to send print jobs to the Print Manager.

When hit, this API will send the next queued print job to the Print Manager
and mark it as Pending in the queue, with the time it was set to Pending.

If the Pending job is not confirmed within 1 minute, libki_cron.pl will
reset the status so another Print Manager can try again.

=head2 job

Print server API to update the status of a job,
including setting a job to:
    QUEUED: Job just added and has not yet been downloaded ( this is the status set by get_pending_job );
    IN_PROGRESS: Job downloaded and has been added to the client-side native printer queue
    DONE: Job printed successfully
    ERROR: Job cannot be printed due to an error
    SUBMITTED: Job submitted to third-party service ( meaning we may not get any feedback on success )
    HELD: Job was successfully submitted but is pending some user action before being QUEUED
