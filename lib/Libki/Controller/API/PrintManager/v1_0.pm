Catalyst Controller.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 jobs

Print server API to send print jobs to the Print Manager.

When hit, this API will send the next queued print job to the Print Manager
and mark it as Pending in the queue, with the time it was set to Pending.

If the Pending job is not confirmed within 1 minute, libki_cron.pl will
reset the status so another Print Manager can try again.
